    <h3>1.why we use template strings?</h3>
    <p><span class="fw-bold text-primary">Answer:</span> Template strings are a powerful feature of modern JavaScript released in ES6. It lets us insert/interpolate variables
    and expressions into strings without needing to concatenate like in older versions of JavaScript. It allows us to create
    strings that are complex and contain dynamic elements.</p>

    <h3>2.what is the difference between var, let and const?</h3>
    <p><span class="fw-bold text-primary">Answer:</span> var declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while let and const are block scoped. Var variables can be
    updated and re-declared. On the other hand let variables can be
    updated but not re-declared. And const variables can not be
    updated and not re-declared</p>

    <h3>3.what is the difference between arrow function and normal function?</h3>
    <p><span class="fw-bold text-primary">Answer:</span> In regular function, you always have to return any value, but in Arrow function you can skip return keyword and write in
    single line.Unlike regular functions, arrow functions do not have their own this . The value of this inside an arrow function
    remains the same throughout the lifecycle of the function and is always bound to the value of this in the closest
    non-arrow parent function.</p>
